    "Questions-1-answer": "Simply enter your departure and arrival city, select a departure (and return) date & time, indicate the number of passengers, then tap or click the search button. You will be provided with a list of train itineraries that you can choose from",
    "Questions-2": " What should I do if the booking is not open? ",
    "Questions-2-answer": " European train tickets are usually available for sale 90 days in advance, but if your preferred ticket is not yet available for purchase, it is probably because your desired ticket is not yet available at that time ",
    "Questions-3": "Why Can't I find the Europe train route I want to book?",
    "Questions-3-answer": " There are several reasons why you might not find your desired train: (1) Your desired train is full, or (2) Your desired train route is not yet available for booking, or (3) Your desired train route is temporarily closed for booking due to track maintenance works, or (4) Your desired train journey might contain more than two changes (our system is designed to filter out any train routes with more than two exchanges to give you the most direct route) ",
    "Questions-4": " Can I reserve a Europe train ticket first and pay within 24-72 hours? ",
    "Questions-4-answer": " At the moment, it is not possible to reserve now and pay for a ticket later with Klook. To secure a ticket, please pay as soon as you have chosen your chosen route ",
    "Questions-5": " How early can I purchase a Europe train ticket? ",

    "Questions-5-answerA": "This varies depending on your selected train routes, and also ranges from countries and types of trains. Generally speaking, many of the European train tickets can be booked as early as 90 days before train departure. Below are some of the recommended timelines for ticket booking according to train type and popular routes:",
